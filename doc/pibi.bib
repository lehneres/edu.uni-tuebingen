@article{MacDonald2009,
	Abstract = {Signaling by the Wnt family of secreted glycolipoproteins via the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin controls embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Here we review recent progress in this so-called canonical Wnt signaling pathway. We discuss Wnt ligands, agonists, and antagonists, and their interactions with Wnt receptors. We also dissect critical events that regulate beta-catenin stability, from Wnt receptors to the cytoplasmic beta-catenin destruction complex, and nuclear machinery that mediates beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Finally, we highlight some key aspects of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in human diseases including congenital malformations, cancer, and osteoporosis, and discuss potential therapeutic implications.},

@article{Dang2005,
	Abstract = {Increased wild-type MYC expression occurs frequently in human cancers, except in Burkitt's lymphoma, where the translocated MYC allele is frequently mutated at several hotspots, including a major one at threonine-58. Acute MYC expression increases p53 or ARF levels and induces apoptosis, and previous transgenic animal studies revealed frequent inactivating mutations of p53 or p19ARF in transgenic Myc-induced lymphomas. Lowe and coworkers (Hemann et al., 2005) demonstrate that wild-type MYC can also trigger apoptosis by inducing Bim, which neutralizes Bcl-2. In contrast, the MYC point mutants failed to induce Bim, promoting murine lymphomas that escaped both wild-type p53 and p19ARF, and in doing so, evaded apoptosis.},

@article{Du2004,
	Abstract = {The genomic organization of the CDK2 gene, which overlaps the melanocyte-specific gene SILV/PMEL17, poses an interesting regulatory challenge. We show that, despite its ubiquitous expression, CDK2 exhibits tissue-specific regulation by the essential melanocyte lineage transcription factor MITF. In addition, functional studies revealed this regulation to be critical for maintaining CDK2 kinase activity and growth of melanoma cells. Expression levels of MITF and CDK2 are tightly correlated in primary melanoma specimens and predict susceptibility to the CDK2 inhibitor roscovitine. CDK2 depletion suppressed growth and cell cycle progression in melanoma, but not other cancers, corroborating previous results. Collectively, these data indicate that CDK2 activity in melanoma is largely maintained at the transcriptional level by MITF, and unlike other malignancies, it may be a suitable drug target in melanoma.},

@article{Berger2010,
	Abstract = {Global studies of transcript structure and abundance in cancer cells
	enable the systematic discovery of aberrations that contribute to
	carcinogenesis, including gene fusions, alternative splice isoforms,
	and somatic mutations. We developed a systematic approach to characterize
	the spectrum of cancer-associated mRNA alterations through integration
	of transcriptomic and structural genomic data, and we applied this
	approach to generate new insights into melanoma biology. Using paired-end
	massively parallel sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) together with analyses
	of high-resolution chromosomal copy number data, we identified 11
	novel melanoma gene fusions produced by underlying genomic rearrangements,
	as well as 12 novel readthrough transcripts. We mapped these chimeric
	transcripts to base-pair resolution and traced them to their genomic
	origins using matched chromosomal copy number information. We also
	used these data to discover and validate base-pair mutations that
	accumulated in these melanomas, revealing a surprisingly high rate
	of somatic mutation and lending support to the notion that point
	mutations constitute the major driver of melanoma progression. Taken
	together, these results may indicate new avenues for target discovery
	in melanoma, while also providing a template for large-scale transcriptome
	studies across many tumor types.},

	Abstract = {DNA microarrays can be used to identify gene expression changes characteristic
	of human disease. This is challenging, however, when relevant differences
	are subtle at the level of individual genes. We introduce an analytical
	strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest
	but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally
	related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved
	in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased
	in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites
	of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1alpha and
	correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate
	this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism
	and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis
	of genomic profiling experiments.},

@article{Subramanian2005,
	Abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool
	in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information
	remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical
	method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting
	gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on
	gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological
	function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how
	GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including
	leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds
	little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival
	in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.
	The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package,
	together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene
	sets.},
